# AI-Powered Geospatial Intelligence Platform: Implementation Plan

## 1. System Architecture

The platform will be built on a microservices architecture. A Next.js frontend communicates with a Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) orchestrator, which routes requests to specialized AI agents. Each agent is a standalone service responsible for a specific data domain.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Mapbox GL JS / Leaflet
- **Backend (Orchestrator)**: Next.js API Routes (Node.js)
- **AI Agents**: Python, Flask / FastAPI, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data, S3-compatible object storage for imagery.
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## 2. Frontend (Next.js)

- **User Interface**:
  - **Natural Language Query Input**: A central search bar for users to enter queries (e.g., "Show urban growth in Dubai since 2020").
  - **Interactive Map**: The primary view, displaying satellite imagery, data overlays, and vector layers (from OpenStreetMap).
  - **Dashboard**: A panel with widgets for charts, statistics, and key metrics derived from agent analysis.
  - **Narrative Summary**: An auto-generated text summary explaining the findings.
- **Workflow**:
  1. User enters a query.
  2. Frontend sends the query to the backend orchestrator.
  3. It receives a task ID and polls for results.
  4. Once results are ready, it fetches the data (JSON with stats, image URLs, GeoJSON) and renders the map layers, dashboard, and summary.

## 3. Backend Orchestrator (Next.js API)

- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Query Endpoint**: A single API route (e.g., `/api/query`) to accept user requests.
  - **NLU & Intent Parsing**: Use a language model (e.g., via OpenAI API or a local model) to parse the natural language query into a structured command (location, time range, analysis types).
  - **Task Dispatching**: Based on the parsed command, make parallel API calls to the relevant AI agents.
  - **Result Aggregation**: Collect responses from all agents.
  - **Insight Synthesis**: Use another AI call to synthesize the aggregated data into a coherent narrative summary.
  - **Response Caching**: Cache results to handle repeated queries efficiently.

## 4. AI Agents (Python Microservices)

Each agent is a Dockerized Flask/FastAPI application with specific responsibilities.

- **Geospatial Agent**:

  - **Input**: Location (lat/lon), time range, analysis type (e.g., 'urban_change', 'vegetation_loss').
  - **Functionality**:
    - Interfaces with Sentinel Hub (as in `app.py`).
    - Runs the U-Net model for change detection.
    - Processes vector data from OpenStreetMap (e.g., road density, building footprints).
  - **Output**: Change mask images, statistics (% change), and relevant GeoJSON data.

- **Socioeconomic Agent**:

  - **Input**: Location/region.
  - **Functionality**: Fetches and analyzes data from sources like the World Bank, Census Bureaus, and real estate APIs (e.g., Zillow).
  - **Output**: JSON with demographic trends, economic indicators, and property value changes.

- **Real Estate Agent**:

  - **Input**: Location/region, time horizon for prediction.
  - **Functionality**:
    - Aggregates real estate data from APIs (e.g., Zillow, Redfin).
    - Analyzes market trends (e.g., median price, inventory levels).
    - Utilizes a predictive model (e.g., time-series forecasting like ARIMA, or a machine learning model like XGBoost) that incorporates features from other agents (e.g., new infrastructure from Geospatial Agent, population growth from Socioeconomic Agent) to forecast property value changes.
  - **Output**: JSON with current market analysis and future price predictions.

- **Environmental Agent**:
  - **Input**: Location, time range.
  - **Functionality**: Analyzes deforestation (Global Forest Watch), air quality, and other environmental metrics.
  - **Output**: JSON with statistics and time-series data for environmental changes.

## 5. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Change Detection Service (MVP)

- **Goal**: Establish the foundational satellite analysis capability.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Refactor `app.py` into a Flask-based microservice (the Geospatial Agent).
  2. Create a simple Next.js frontend with a map and a form to query the agent directly.
  3. Display "before" and "after" images and the change overlay on the map.
  4. Dockerize the Geospatial Agent.

### Phase 2: Orchestrator and First Integration

- **Goal**: Introduce the orchestrator and a second agent.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Build the Next.js orchestrator API.
  2. Implement basic NLU for parsing location and dates.
  3. Develop the Socioeconomic Agent to fetch population data.
  4. The orchestrator calls both agents and combines the results.
  5. Enhance the frontend to display a simple dashboard with population stats alongside the map.

### Phase 3: Full-Featured Platform

- **Goal**: Realize the vision of a multi-faceted intelligence platform.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Develop additional agents (Environmental, Infrastructure).
  2. Implement advanced, context-aware NLU.
  3. Implement the AI-powered narrative summary generation.
  4. Build a comprehensive and interactive dashboard with multiple widgets.
  5. Set up a robust data caching and storage solution (Postgres/PostGIS, S3).

### Phase 4: Scaling and Enhancement

- **Goal**: Prepare the platform for production use.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Optimize agent performance and model inference speed.
  2. Implement user authentication and authorization.
  3. Deploy the entire system using Kubernetes for scalability.
  4. Expand the portfolio of data sources and analysis types.
